# Layout

You specify the layout for a page in its [front matter]. Just the Docs has a `default` layout with a sidebar, used for almost all pages in the theme docs, and a `minimal` layout that omits the sidebar.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## The layout concept

See the [Jekyll docs page about layouts] for an explanation of the general idea of layouts and how to specify them.

You can use [Jekyll's front matter defaults] to specify the same layout for many pages.


# Configuration
